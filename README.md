# Iron_Ore_Quality_Prediction

Iron ore concentrate quality is impacted by the amount of impurity (silica content).
By predicting the impurity, preventive actions can be taken to improve quality as well as minimize rework or even waste.

The objectives of this projects are:
* Create a model to predict iron ore quality (which is represented by the amount of silica content).
* Find determinant features to iron ore quality.
